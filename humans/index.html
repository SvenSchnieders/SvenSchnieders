  <p>The modern scientific age has brought about a drastic change in the way we humans see ourselves. Throughout history, we considered ourselves special and important; after all, we were created in the image of God. The earth was at the center of the universe, and everything on earth was created for us (special) humans. It was a beautiful image, which unfortunately turned out to be wrong.</p>
<h3 id="a-little-history">A Little History</h3>
<p>The picture began to crumble when Copernicus proposed his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism">heliocentric</a> model of our universe in 1543. Instead of placing the earth, and with it us humans, in the center, the sun now took our place. It became increasingly difficult to reject the model, especially with the evidence available after Galileo&rsquo;s invention of the telescope in 1609. But the scientific revolution did not stop there. In 1858 Darwin published his idea of evolution by natural selection, which tried to explain how humans could develop without a God. We changed from the special children of God to more or less intelligent animals.</p>
<p>Due to these discoveries and many more like it, the faith in religion started to decline. It became increasingly popular to hold a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism">materialist</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism">physicalist</a>) perspective. The view that everything, including us humans with our minds, emerges from the interactions of particles governed by natural laws. In this world, there was no need for a God or any other mystical force. Therefore, many scientists today would say that we humans are merely an insignificant accident of nature flying around on some random blue ball in space.</p>
<h3 id="the-weather">The Weather</h3>
<p>Computer scientists, like Stephen Wolfram, go even one step further. He explains in <a href="https://youtu.be/ez773teNFYA?t=260">this interview</a> that the computation that is going on in our brain, it is not more sophisticated (special) than other computations in nature—e.g., the computation of the weather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In other words, people will say: well, yes, we are used to computers—things we&rsquo;ve created, digital things we&rsquo;ve created—being sort of intelligent like we are. And they&rsquo;ll say: oh, we are also used to the idea that there are things around us in the universe that are kind of intelligent like we are, except they don&rsquo;t share the civilizational history we have.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From his point of view, the only difference between the computation that takes place in our brains and the computation of, say, the weather is that our brains compute something we care about. In other words, there is no non-human-centric definition of intelligence under which we are more intelligent than the weather. The difference lies only in the narrative we create around our computation.</p>
<h3 id="computation">Computation</h3>
<p>These claims are based on some incredible progress in theoretical computer science; mainly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Church-Turing thesis</a> and the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing completeness</a>—i.e., computationally universality.</p>
<p>The Church-Turing thesis states that <em>all</em> systems, which manipulate an input according to some fixed rules, can be simulated by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>. In other words: everything that is computable is computable by a Turing machine. The consequence of this thesis is an upper limit for computation. There is no “more sophisticated” computation than the one a Turing machine can perform. This upper limit is called Turing completeness or computational universality, and once a system has reached this universality, it can perform all possible computations. The Church-Turing thesis is probably the most important idea in all of computer science, but it is also very strange, as people like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521199565/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0521199565&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=34a5ab8a05196059190f77dcc1f465c3&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Scott Aaronson</a> have rightly pointed out, because what does it really say? Is it a claim about physical reality? A definition of computation? In a sense, it is both.</p>
<p>A Turing machine is a mathematical model for computation witch conveniently assumes infinite memory, so what about physically realizable system?—are they also Turing complete? For two systems to be computationally equivalent, both of them have to be able to simulate the other. We have already established that a Turing machine can simulate all other machines, but which systems can simulate a Turing machine? It turns out: surprisingly many.</p>
<p>Not only are normal computers computationally equivalent to a Turing machine (after all, that is why we build them), but simple cellular automatons and other systems are as well. Stephen Wolfram shows in his book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579550088/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1579550088&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e8e81171298eb2fc7964f9440c554d7b&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">A New Kind of Science</a></em> how many simple-seeming systems are computationally universal. It turns out that the threshold for computational universality is much lower than previously thought. And he observed that if a system is not obviously simple, it is probably computationally universal. One of the most famous examples of Turing completeness in simple systems is the rule <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">110 cellular automaton</a>.</p>

<p>The rules shown above in picture 1 are extremely simple but, nonetheless, create this chaotic and complex seeming structure (picture 2) if we start with only one black cell and keep on applying them.</p>
<p>It seems difficult to believe that this system is computationally universal, but it is. This means that it can perform the same computations that any modern computer or your smartphone can perform. Let that sink in. The automaton with these eight simple rules shown in picture 1, can, given the right starting condition (input), perform every computation you want. Admittedly, it would be very slow and inefficient, but the important part is that there is only a <em>quantitative</em> difference between the automaton and the device you are reading this essay on, <em>not a qualitative</em> one.</p>
<p>So the picture is looking pretty bleak for us humans: our earth is not in the middle of the universe; God did (probably) not create us; and whatever is going on in our brains, is not a more sophisticated computation than the ones automaton 110 or the weather can perform. It becomes clear why many people are convicted that in the grand scheme of things—in our big universe—we humans are insignificant. So why do I say that humans are special and significant?</p>
<h3 id="the-continuum">The Continuum</h3>
<p>There still seems to be one way out of the weather-brain equivalence: what if the brain is not a computer? After all, we do not know all physical laws, neither do we understand fully what is going in our brain (otherwise, we would not be having this discussion right now).</p>
<p>The problem with this criticism is that it does not help us much. Even if we assume some strange physical laws, which, for example, act on a continuous rather than a discrete substrate and are therefore not computable in the classical sense, a Turing machine can, with discrete computation, simulate continuous physics with arbitrary precision. So no luck on this front.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-general-intelligence">Artificial General Intelligence</h3>
<p>There is, however, a different problem with Wolfram&rsquo;s argument that does not require an uncomputable continuous substrate. He assumes that because the computation in our brain is only Turing complete—i.e., computationally equivalent to a Turing machine—it cannot be special. A related error underlies the assertion that because we can, in theory, simulate any physical system to an arbitrary degree with a Turing machine, we must be able to build an Artificial-General-Intelligence (AGI).</p>
<p>The problem here is that we do not know how precise we need to simulate a brain so that human intelligence emerges. If, as believed by many scientists today, simulating the brain at the neuron level is sufficient for the emergence of general intelligence, then it is indeed possible to build an AGI. If, on the other hand, we need to simulate everything down to the quantum level (or even further to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units">Planck scale</a>) because it turns out that whatever is going on down there is important for the emergence of general intelligence, we will not be able to simulate the brain on a physical resizable computer. The amount of information needed is simply too much. We do not know what the correct level of abstraction is, but this example suffices to show that building an AGI in practice (even assuming a discrete physical computation is going on in the brain) might be impossible. The right level of abstraction is probably somewhere in between, but I would guess that it is much closer to the quantum level than to the neuron level.</p>
<h3 id="the-special-brain">The Special Brain</h3>
<p>So looking again at our brain-weather comparison, we can see that although in theory, the weather could perform the same computations as the brain (given enough time and memory), it does not follow that whatever computation the brain is performing in practice is not special. In fact, we know that it is because only humans wonder about these questions in the first place; only humans create new explanations for phenomena in nature; only humans create new knowledge and new technologies.</p>
<p>Wolfram and others are inclined to answer that this is exactly what they mean by “computations we humans care about.” However, the idea that the difference between our computation and the computation of the weather is merely subjective and hence insignificant is wrong. There is an objective difference that makes humans significant, and that is our ability to create new knowledge. This new knowledge is not only important because we care about it, but also because it lets us transform our environment. The special kind of computation we perform, although maybe computationally equivalent to the computation of the weather, lets us control the weather—not the other way around. We can transform matter in ways not possible for other animals or systems in nature.</p>
<h3 id="human-significance">Human Significance</h3>
<p>If we manage to not blow ourselves up, we have the ability to transform much of our galaxy over the next one hundred thousand years. How can anyone call us insignificant? In fact, the significance of us humans cannot be overstated. Whatever the weather is here on earth, it has no significance on, say, Mars. But we humans might one day build cities there; we might one day nuke the mars to heat it; we might one day be able to travel to other galaxies. If humans would go extinct right now, the influence we had on the universe is still negligible. To find traces of us, you would have to look very closely at the earth, so it would be reasonable to call us insignificant. But in a couple of thousand years, this picture could be completely different. And it is only us humans who have the potential to make these significant changes to distant stars. Not the weather nor any other system on earth can change the universe as significantly as can. We humans, with our special ability to create new knowledge, will be responsible for all of it.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to add a soul or a God to make us humans special. Even if you accept all our best scientific theories and a materialistic world view, we humans are still special and significant. As a matter of fact, the potential of us humans is infinite.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my essay.</p>
<p><em>As with most of my essay, I stand on the shoulder of giants (almost never on a pile of dwarfs, although it also works): much of this essay, as well as much of my general worldview, is based on David Deutsch&rsquo;s works, especially on his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143121359/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143121359&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=638f0121f7500c68a5b099bbe8c29f5f&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">The Beginning Of Infinity</a>.</em></p>
